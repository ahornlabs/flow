Upgrade Instructions
====================

This section contains instructions for upgrading your Flow 4.2 based applications to Flow 4.4.

In general just make sure to run the command::

 ./flow flow:cache:flush --force

If you are upgrading from a lower version than 4.2, be sure to read the upgrade instructions from
the previous Release Notes first.

What has changed
----------------

Flow 4.0 comes with a major change in the routing and numerous fixes. Here's a list of changes that might need special
attention when upgrading.

!!! More extensible Routing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Flow-routing is improved and now allows the definition of RoutingParameters via HTTP-components that can later
on be handled by custom RoutePartHandlers. That way the routing can react to influences other than the uri-path like
the requested host-name or scheme or any other computable value.

Attention:  The signature of the internal Router implementation has changed. In the unlikely case that you replaced
the flow-router with a custom-router you have to adjust your code accordingly.

PHP 7.2 compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Flow framework now support php7.2 and all tests are executed for PHP 7.0, 7.1 and 7.2.
