Add methods ``csrfToken``, ``isAuthenticated`` and ``hasAccess`` to ``Security`` EelHelper
==========================================================================================
- `csrfToken` returns CSRF token which is required for "unsafe" requests (e.g. POST, PUT, DELETE, ...)
- `isAuthenticated` returns true, if any account is currently authenticated
- `hasAccess` returns true, if access to the given privilege-target is granted

The methods add features that previously were available as viewHelpers to Eel so they can be used in Fusion directly.

Add ``format`` method to String EEL Helper
==========================================
This method pretty much just redirects its arguments to the PHP-native
`vsprintf` and allows to format strings without `'' + ''` interpolation.

Make recursion limit for the debugger configurable via settings
===============================================================
With the default recursion Limit of 50 php often runs into memory-limits when debugging larger data structures. 
This change allows to define the recursionLimit via Settings. In addition the default recursionLimit is set to 5.

======================================================
Potentially breaking changes (unplanned extensibility)
======================================================

Introduce ActionResponse in preparation for clean PSR-7
=======================================================
This is the continuation to a clear separation between MVC and HTTP stacks.
The introduced ActionResponse offers a very limited interface to work with
on the MVC level, with the following methods:

setContent()
setContentType()
setRedirectUri()
setStatusCode()
setComponentParameter()
Everything in the currently used HTTP\Response is still available but deprecated and will be removed in the next major, 
so make sure to adapt to the above API.

This change is marked breaking due to the deprecations, it should not break any existing code.
setContent() accepts also PSR-7 StreamInterface implementations and will likely only accept those in the next major.
A detailed blog post with the next steps will follow and go into more detail about the final separation and usage.
Special note regarding the setComponentParameter, for now this is your extensible portal towards HTTP. 
You can use it to set component parameters for your own HTTP components to set additional headers.

We are likely to extend the interface slightly for the major release as we are aware that this implementation is very limiting, 
but we need a clean separation between MVC and HTTP to start with.

Deprecate PackageManagerInterface
=================================
As the package manager cannot be overwritten the interface is purely
cosmetic and IF you actually use the package manager in your codebase
(which you probably should not in the first place) you can just inject the
``PackageManager`` directly instead of the interface.


Upgraded our internal testing suite to latest neos/behat version
================================================================
In case you have behat tests in place, but did not set your own behat version in the dev dependencies in your own, 
there mightbe some changes that could break your tests within the behat version that is now aquired by Flow / Neos.
