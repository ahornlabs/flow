~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`BUGFIX: Make CLI subprocesses work on Windows <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1053>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On Windows, the PHP_BINDIR constant will resolve to "C:\\php" no matter what the actual php directory is, because this constant is decided at compile time. However, the PHP_BINARY constant will resolve to the current executable that runs the script at runtime, which at least for CLI will be the PHP executable.

This is a backport of #1010

`BUGFIX: Avoid a syntax error from hiding the intended error message <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1050>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The error code for the Package Manager error on duplicate packages was
a millisecond timestamp. Since this is larger than MAX_INT PHP parses
this as float, which in turn is not accepted as parameter for an
exception code.
