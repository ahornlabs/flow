`BUGFIX: Fallback if custom exception rendering fails <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/354>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a custom exception rendering fails, the exception would not be
caught and thus difficult to debug. Instead as a fallback exceptions
thrown during rendering will be rendered statically.

`BUGFIX: Packages without classes should still monitor configuration and xliff <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/352>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Packages without configured class files were exempted from monitoring to reduce
the amount of monitored files. This is fine for class files but monitoring of
configuration and xliff files should happen for all packages regardless if they
have configured class files or not.
