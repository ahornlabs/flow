`BUGFIX: PersistenceManager correctly checks and reattempts lost connections <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/926>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This change replaces the previously put in place try/catch attempt at handling lost connections
with a proper explicit call to the doctrine connection's `ping()` method.
As a side-effect, this will no longer trigger the `AllObjectsPersisted` signal if flushing fails, however
this is not really breaking, since in those circumstances, the application is supposed to not do any
further work anyway.

Fixes #870

This is a follow-up to #921 - see discussion there.

`BUGFIX: Annotate logoutAction with SkipCsrfProtection <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1014>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes (especially in Neos) on logout the CSRF token is missing (`CsrfTokenMissing` interceptor). No harm in ignoring it here.
