`BUGFIX: fix resource publishing <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1844>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This fixes a regression introduced in #1842:

In this change, a "yield" and a "return" call were introduced in the
same method; so that the early return was not properly executed
because PHP somehow thought this is a fully-suspendable function,
although only one part of the "if"-statement was suspendable.
