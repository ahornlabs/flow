`BUGFIX: Make sure to use only a consistent NumbersReaderCache <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1991>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It might happen that there is a discrepancy between parsedFormatsIndices and parsedFormats cache. We need to make sure we are accessing the consistent information instead of relying that both are there, to avoid a PHP exception.

Same fix was already applied to DatesReader, see https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1899.

Resolves #564

`BUGFIX: Fix error handling for importing resources <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1888>`_

While working with `ResourceManager` I noticed that importing non-existent resources would fail later in the process than expected: They would only fail when trying to copy the temporary file to it's persistent location instead of failing when fetching the original file.

**What I did**
This PR fixes the incorrect error handling of fetching files when importing resources.

**How I did it**
The code assumed that `copy` would throw an exception if it failed - however, it returns `false` in that case.

**How to verify it**
Try to import a non-existent resource (e.g. http://example.com/this-file-does-not-exist). It should now correctly throw the `Could not copy the file from "..." to temporary file "..."` exception  from `WritableFileSystemStorage::importResource` instead of the much later `The temporary file of the file import could not be moved to the final target "..."` from `WritableFileSystemStorage::moveTemporaryFileToFinalDestination`
