~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`TASK: Avoid code migration error if source file does not exist <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1483>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This avoids errors like `fatal: bad source, source=Packages/Sites/Acme.AcmeCom/Resources/Private/Fusion/Root.ts2, destination=Packages/Sites/Acme.AcmeCom/Resources/Private/Fusion/Root.fusion` during `core:migrate`.

`TASK: Use proper dummy hash in PersistedUsernamePasswordProvider <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1495>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This replaces the dummy hash used to prevent timing based attacks by
a valid hash for a random password that was never actually stored
somewhere.

This avoids problems with PHP's encryption methods. With the
previous hash, the hashing was sometimes not applied properly
and the method returns early so that the time-based information
disclosure vulnerability still exists.

`BUGFIX: Support "/" in file upload fields <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1469>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adds support for file uploads with "/"s in their names.
Adds a `Request::calculateFieldPathsAsArray` method
returning the paths as arrays instead of "/"-separated strings
(later "/"-split again).
Keeps the `calculateFieldPaths` method returning the paths as
strings for backwards-compatibility.

Fixes #1467
