`!!! BUGFIX: Allow actually reconfiguring the ThrowableStorage <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1422>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This fixes the instantiation and configuration of ThrowableStorage
implementations and also fixes stack traces and HTTP request information
in stored throwables.

This change is not breaking but as pre notice that in the next major the
`ThrowableStorageInterface` will have an additional method that is currently
commented and already used to instantiate throwable storages.
If you implement the interface you must already implement that additional 
method despite it being not part of the interface. As the object configuration
for throwable storage doesn't work without this change there cannot be a
working alternative implementation yet, so this shouldn't break any project.

`BUGFIX: Avoid "wrong" error if Redis is unavailable <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1431>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At least when running unit tests for the `MultiBackend` the `connect()`
call raises an error that circumvents exception handling and breaks
correct execution.

`BUGFIX: Add nullable parameter detection <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1388>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nullable paramters (type prepended with `?`) were introduced with PHP 7.1
see https://secure.php.net/manual/en/migration71.new-features.php#migration71.new-features.nullable-types

We need to support a syntax like `functionName(?string $param)`. Without this fix, this function will get extended as `functionName(string $param)`, which is incompatible.

Starting with PHP 7.1 `functionName(string $param = null)` can also be written as `functionName(?string $param = null)` (but not as ~~`functionName(?string $param)`~~).

For the upmerge with Flow >= 5.0, the PHP version check in line 275 can be removed since at least PHP 7.1 is required there.
