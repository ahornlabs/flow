`BUGFIX: Handle nullable property annotations correctly <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1780>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This fixes a regression introduced with #1640, which caused properties on entities annotated as nullable (`|null`) to throw an exception during reflection time in Flow.

Since #1640 we more strictly parse type annotations. Before, something like `string|null` was parsed as just `string` (and even `stringnull` would have worked, which was obviously wrong). With the bugfix , a `|null` was no longer parsed, because a whitespace or line ending was expected at the end of the type annotation `(?:\\s|$)`.

This change fixes this, by explicitly allowing `null|` and `|null` in the parser regex - all other type unions are still not allowed because we can not resolve that to some useful type information.

Resolves #1779

`BUGFIX: Undo \`dirname\` simplification in getScriptRequestPath <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1787>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was broken in the PSR7 move, by replacing the explode/array_pop/implode logic with a simple dirname. On Windows, you in most cases end up with a single `\` which in turn results in generating URLs like `/\\/`. This change simply changes the code back to the pre-PSR state, which worked fine.

Resolves #1785
