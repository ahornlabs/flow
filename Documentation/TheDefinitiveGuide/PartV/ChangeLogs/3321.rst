`BUGFIX: Correct use of \`void\` return type in proxy classes <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1091>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As `void` was not on the list of return types that would be
normalized to include a leading backslash in the reflection
data it would be output wrongly in proxy classes and so break
applications that used it.

Fixes: #1065
