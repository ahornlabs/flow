`BUGFIX: Fix ObjectAccessorNode::getPropertyPath for is/has access in PHP7 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/350>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This fixes the try/catch for undefined Fluid variables which start with "is" or "has".
Currently, exceptions here are not being caught because an `\\Error` is being thrown.
Since non-callable method call should not be attempted in the first place, this change
adds a is_callable check. Therefore a try/catch block is no longer necessary, as any exception thrown inside the callable method should bubble up.

Specific example: a fluid section/partial with an optional argument called "isSomething"

- if rendered while defining isSomething in the arguments, there's no problem
- if rendered without isSomething in the arguments (implicit falsy), we then get
  `Call to undefined method TYPO3\\Fluid\\Core\\ViewHelper\\TemplateVariableContainer::isSomething()`

`BUGFIX: Class loading errors because library packageKeys are incorrect <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/345>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The package manager derives the packageKey from the class loader configuration
if the package type is ``library``. This leads to problems with the split
libraries that share the namespace ``TYPO3\\\Flow\\\Utility`` because the
package state configuration for is overwritten.

Depending on the dependency order of the packages this will lead to symptoms
like class loading errors for the ``Neos.Utility.Schema`` package.

This change adds the specific packageKey to use to the composer.json to
load the libraries correctly.
