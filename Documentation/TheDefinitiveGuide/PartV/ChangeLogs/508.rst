---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`BUGFIX: Extend the expected exceptions for missing templates and sections <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1378>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

typo3fluid/fluid expects specific exceptions to be thrown to implement
the feature of optional sections and partials. Neos.FluidAdaptor has to
throw these exceptions or derivates of them. Otherwise the exceptions won't
be catched and displayed to the user.

fixes: #1347 

Follow-Up for #1348 with correct target.
