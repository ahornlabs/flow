Overview of merged pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`BUGFIX: Make CLI subprocesses work on Windows <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1010>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On Windows, the `PHP_BINDIR` constant will resolve to "C:\\php" no matter what the actual php directory is, because this constant is decided at compile time. However, the `PHP_BINARY` constant will resolve to the current executable that runs the script at runtime, which at least for CLI will be the PHP executable.

* Packages: ``Flow``

`BUGFIX: Integer argumentName should not result in an exception <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/954>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This prevents an exception in case an argument name is evaluated to
another simple type (integer) but can be converted to string easily.

Fixes: #612

`BUGFIX: Keep format for URIs built in subrequests <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/985>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adds handling for the `@format` argument when merging arguments
from the request hierarchy to keep the format when building
URIs from a sub request.

Fixes neos/neos-development-collection#1596

`TASK: Fix typo in @return annotation <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1006>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`BUGFIX: FileSystemTargetTest shouldn't create package stub <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1005>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FileSystemTargetTest was fixed earlier to no longer create a stub
of a package during test runs in the real filesystem see PR #966.)

The test still created a stub package, because the FileSystemTarget
was told to publish to a vfs location - but that option is only used
if initializeObject() is called, which in unit tests does not happen
automagically.

`TASK: Ignore invalid cookie names instead of throwing an exception <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/971>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This prevents the exception that is thrown when a cookie has an invalid name.
